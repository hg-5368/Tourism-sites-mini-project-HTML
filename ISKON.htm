    </h2>
    <p>
        <font face="Bahnschrift"><strong> ISKCON </strong>is an organization founded by <strong> Srila Prabhupada</strong> , a Bengalee born at Kolkata, who at the age of 69 embarked on this mission of spreading the message of Krishna in foreign countries as per the orders of his spiritual master <em> Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura </em>. It follows the Gaudiya Vaishnab Tradition of Sri Chaitanaya Mahaprabhu. As a result of Srila Prabhupadas endeavor, many foreigners across the globe got acquainted with the Vedic culture and Sanatana dharma. They adopted a Saatvic lifestyle as prescribed in the Vedic scriptures.
            Mayapur ISKCON temple,<em>the birth place of <strong> Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu</strong></em> , is the Head Quarter of ISKCON. It is one of the 20 sacred places most visited in the whole world with almost 5 million visitants/guests around the year. Mayapur is located on the banks of the Ganges river, at the point of its confluence with the Jalangi, near Navadvip, 130 km north of Kolkata. The headquarters of ISKCON are situated in Mayapur considered a holy place by a number of other traditions within Hinduism, but is of special significance to followers of Gaudiya Vaishnavism as the birthplace of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, regarded as a special incarnation of Krishna in the mood of Radha.
            ISKCON devotees follow a disciplic line of Gaudiya Bhagavata Vaishnavas and are the largest branch of Gaudiya Vaishnavism. Vaishnavism means worship of Vishnu, and Gauda refers to the area where this particular branch of Vaishnavism originated, in the Gauda region of West Bengal. Gaudiya Vaishnavism has had a following in India, especially West Bengal and Odisha, for the past five hundred years. Bhaktivedanta Swami disseminated Gaudiya Vaishnava Theology in the Western world through extensive writings and translations, including the Bhagavad Gita, Srimad Bhagavatam (Bhagavata Purana), Chaitanya Charitamrita, and other scriptures. These works are now available in more than seventy languages and serve as the canon of ISKCON. Many are available online.
            Krishna is described as the source of all the avatars of God. Thus ISKCON devotees worship Krishna as the highest form of God, svayam bhagavan, and often refer to Him as "the Supreme Personality of Godhead" in writing, which was a phrase coined by Prabhupada in his books on the subject. To devotees, Radha represents Krishnas divine female counterpart, the original spiritual potency, and the embodiment of divine love. The individual soul is an eternal personal identity which does not ultimately merge into any formless light or void as suggested by the monistic (Advaita) schools of Hinduism. Prabhupada most frequently offers Sanatana-dharma and Varnashrama dharma as more accurate names for the religious system which accepts Vedic authority.It is a monotheistic tradition which has its roots in the theistic Vedanta traditions.</font>
