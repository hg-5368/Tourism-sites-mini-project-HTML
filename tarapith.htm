It so called because the <strong>eyeball (Tara) of Sati</strong> here. Others say that Tarapith is not a pith but the place owes its sanctity to the fact that the Sage Basistha here worshipped the Goddess Sati in the form of Tara. The Goddess Tara is a form of Kali with two hands, garlanded with snakes and adorned in sacred threads. But the Temple is dedicated to the destructive aspect of Shiva, which takes the form of Kali. She requires sacrifice daily to satisfy her blood lust so every morning goats are sacrifices on the altar of the Temple.
