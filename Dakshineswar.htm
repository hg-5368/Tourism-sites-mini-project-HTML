        <font face="Bahnschrift">Dakshineswar Kali temple is one of the holiest places of Eastern India. It is one of
            the must visit places in Kolkata. Dakshineswar is a Hindu temple located in Dakshineswar near Kolkata.
            Situated on the eastern bank of the Hooghly River, the presiding deity of the temple is Bhavatarini. The
            temple was built by Rani Rashmoni, a philanthropist and a devotee of Kali in 1855. The temple is famous for
            its association with Ramakrishna, a mystic of 19th century Bengal. The temple compound, apart from the
            nine-spired main temple, contains a large courtyard surrounding the temple, with rooms along the boundary
            walls. There are twelve shrines dedicated to Shiva (Kalis companion) along the riverfront, a temple to
            Radha-Krishna, a bathing ghat on the river and a shrine dedicated to Rani Rashmoni. Nahavat-Khana, the
            chamber in the northwestern corner just beyond the last of the Shiva temples, is where Ramakrishna spent a
            considerable part of his life. <br> <br>

            In the early 1800s, Dakshineswar was a small village along the eastern banks of River Ganga. Dense forests
            surrounded the area where the famous Dakshineswar temple stands today. It was 300 years back when
            Durgaprasad Roy Choudhury and Bhavaniprasad Roy Choudhury, members of the renowned Savarna Roy Choudhury
            family settled here. Yogindranath, one of the successors of this family, was an ardent devotee of Sri
            Ramakrishna who later was known as Swami Yogananda. <br> <br>

            The famous Dakshineswar temple which houses Goddess Kali was founded by Rani Rashmoni following a dream she
            saw when she was about to embark on her pilgrimage to Benaras. A long term plan of the Rani materialized
            which she had longed to perform when her husband died with the unfulfilled wish of constructing a Kali
            temple. The idols of the Gods and the Goddess were decided to be installed on the snana-yatra day, an
            auspicious day for the Hindus. On 31st May 1855, more than 1 lakh Brahmins were invited from different parts
            of the country to grace the auspicious occasion amidst the controversy of the Rani being in no position to
            own a temple and to offer Brahmins to feed since she was of low birth. The Rani lived only for five years
            and nine months after the inauguration of the temple. She seriously fell ill in 1861. Realizing that death
            was approaching she decided to handover the property (which she purchased in Dinajpur (now in Bangladesh) as
            a legacy). For the maintenance of the temple to the temple trust she accomplished her task on 18th February,
            1861 and passed away on the subsequent day.</font>
